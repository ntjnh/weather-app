A JS app for getting weather conditions for your geographic location or a location you've searched for.

The app uses the Open Weather API for weather and location data.

This is an update/refresh of the [weather app I made a few years ago](https://github.com/ntjnh/local-weather) when I was learning JS through freeCodeCamp.
